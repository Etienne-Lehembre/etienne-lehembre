I'm Etienne Lehembre, a postdoctoral researcher currently working in **data science** and **machine learning**. My background is focused on **theoretical computer science**, but I'm currently looking at algorithms considering the mathematical relations inside **structured data**. I worked on **subgraphs** and **chemical data** during my thesis, but I'm currently getting on board with **sequential data** and **forecasting models**.

My PhD thesis, was part of the ANR project [InvolvD](https://involvd.greyc.fr/). I designed methods aiming to **expose** the **ambiguities** hidden behind the **expert's prior**. I aslo took an interest in the leverages available to **guide** an expert through a dataset they don't know in the most robust possible manner. These work led me to study the **evaluation process** of the **interactive pattern mining** methods in order to improve them.

Nowadays, studying **reinforcement and machine learning** in the scope of the [Junon](https://www.brgm.fr/fr/programme/junon-jumeaux-numeriques-au-service-ressources-naturelles) project. In this setting, I work with **hydro-geologist** on the **integration** of their **expert knowledge** in a machine learning model. In order to take into account the expert knowledge, I developed a novel **neural network architecture** using the **physical equations** to modify the latent space, leading to better, and more **explainable**, predictive performance.
