    "text": "Greetings dear visitor. I’m Etienne Lehembre, a postdoctoral researcher currently working in data science. My background is focused on theoretical computer science, but I’m currently focusing on algorithms considering the mathematical relations inside structured data. I worked on subgraphs and pharmacophores during my thesis, but I’m currently getting on board with sequential data and forecasting machine learning.\nRegarding my PhD thesis, I worked in an ANR project called InvolvD. I designed methods aiming to lift the ambiguities hidden behind the expert’s prior. I’m also interested in the leverages available to guide an expert through a dataset they don’t know in the most robust possible manner. Which led me to study the evaluation process of the interactive pattern mining methods in order to improve them.\nNowadays, I’m taking an interest in reinforcement and machine learning in the scope of the project Junon. In this project, I’m working with hydro-geologist on the integration of their expert knowledge in a machine learning model.\nAlso, I forgot to mention that I’m currently bouldering, so, see you on the wall !"

This tools allows to exploit the partial order relation of the subgraph inclusion to structure the pattern language. It allows the application of several quality measures and implements novel ones as the Oustanding Pattern Selector (OPS), also known as the Pharmacophore Activity Delta selector (PAD), and the Eclat measure. This tools also implements the Wave Top-k Random-d Family Search (WTRFS) exploration algorithm designed to guide experts in an unknown subgraph pattern language without any prior. [GREYC]\n2023 - 2024: Supervision of an internship in second year of engineering.\nThe internship was focused on the development of soothsayers, a novel way of evaluating interactive pattern mining methods. Soothsayers are oracles making controlled errors and simulating the learning curve of a user. Originally developed for WaveLSea, soothsayers allows us to evaluate the robustness of interactive pattern mining algorithms. The soothsayers have been added to an implementation of LeTSip and Dispale and have given satisfying results. [GREYC]\n2022 - 2023: Supervision of an internship in second year of masters degree.\nThe intership was focused on the creation of a User Interface for the SGPEx package. The intern had to: add a websocket to the pre-existing code with boost beast, create a JavaScript web server using Node.js for the HTML content and Cytoscape.js for the graph visualization, and run experiments on the WTRFS algorithm.
