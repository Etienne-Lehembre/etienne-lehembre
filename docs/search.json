    "text": "Greetings dear visitor. I’m Etienne Lehembre, a PhD student currently working in data science. As my background is focused on theoretical computer science, I’m currently focusing on algorithm considering the mathematical relations inside structured data. Which explains why I’m working on subgraphs and pharmacophores. At the current state of the art, I’m designing methods aiming to lift the ambiguities hidden behind the expert’s prior. I’m also interested in the leverages available to guide an expert through a dataset they doesn’t know in the most robust possible manner. Which leads me to study the current evaluation process of the interactive pattern mining methods in order to improve them. Also, I forgot to mention that I’m currently bouldering, so, see you on the wall !"

This tools allows to exploit the partial order relation of the subgraph inclusion to structure the pattern language. It allows the application of several quality measures and implements novel ones as the Oustanding Pattern Selector (OPS), also known as the Pharmacophore Activity Delta selector (PAD), and the Eclat measure. This tools also implements the Wave Top-k Random-d Family Search (WTRFS) exploration algorithm designed to guide experts in an unknown subgraph pattern language without any prior. [GREYC]\n2022 - 2023: Supervision of an internship in second year of masters degree. The intership was focused on the creation of a User Interface for the SGPEx package. The intern had to: add a websocket to the pre-existing code with boost beast, create a JavaScript web server using Node.js for the HTML content and Cytoscape.js for the graph visualization, and run experiments on the WTRFS algorithm. [University of Caen Normandy]\n2018 - 2019: Developer internship. Development of a mobile game engine for interactive story telling on Android. Including the User Interface design, sound design, parameters, history management, rollback, etc… The development included the use of Unity, C#, and several other tools. [NORSEMAN Interactive]"
