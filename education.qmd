## Education

**2021 - 2024: PhD in computer science.** [ANR InvovlD](https://involvd.greyc.fr/): Interactive Structured Pattern Mining ([ANR-20-CE23-0023](https://anr.fr/Projet-ANR-20-CE23-0023)). The thesis is developed in collaboration with drug design scientists working on molecules and pharmacophores. This work aims to use a Partially Ordered Graph to provide key elements to chemists in order to help them discover key fragments for biological activity. For that we use various techniques as: local contrast selector (Outstanding Pattern Selector) and interactive reinforcement learning. \[[GREYC](https://www.greyc.fr/en/home/), [University of Caen](https://www.unicaen.fr/)\]

**2020 - 2021: Research internship.** Six-month internship in chemoinformatics supervised by A. ZIMMERMANN, B. CUISSART and A. OUALI ; funded by [ANR InvovlD](https://involvd.greyc.fr/). The theme concerns the structuring of graph mining and the introduction of interactivity into the latter.\[[GREYC](https://www.greyc.fr/en/home/)\]

**2019-2020: Research internship.** Three month internship supervised by P. CARON, covering the understanding of some of the sub-families of star-free languages. \[[LITIS](https://www.litislab.fr/en)\]

**2015 - 2021: Bachelor and Master in theoretical computer science.** Formation in computer science and applied mathematics. Main topics where: Formal Languages, Computability, Algorithmic, Cryptography, Logic, Information Theory, Data Mining, Algorithmic Formal Analysis, Game Theory, Algebraic Combinatorics and Enumeration, Automata Theory, Quantum Computer Science, etc... \[[University of Rouen](https://www.univ-rouen.fr/)\]
