## Other Conferences

**2024 - 2025: Conference of Knowledge Extraction and Management ([EGC](https://egc2023.sciencesconf.org/)).** \[[LIFO](https://www.univ-orleans.fr/lifo/?lang=en)\]

## Engineering

**2021 - 2024: Creation of the research tool [SGPEx](https://hal.science/hal-04057516/).**\
The SubGraph Pattern Explorer is a C++ package with a JS UI designed to guide experts through a subgraph pattern language. This tools allows to exploit the partial order relation of the subgraph inclusion to structure the pattern language. It allows the application of several quality measures and implements novel ones as the [Oustanding Pattern Selector](https://hal.science/hal-03658500v1/file/IDA2022-E-LEHEMBRE.pdf) (OPS), also known as the Pharmacophore Activity Delta selector (PAD), and the Eclat measure. This tools also implements the Wave Top-k Random-d Family Search (WTRFS) exploration algorithm designed to guide experts in an unknown subgraph pattern language without any prior. \[[GREYC](https://www.greyc.fr/en/home/)\]

**2023 - 2024: Supervision of an internship in second year of engineering.**\
The internship was focused on the development of soothsayers, a novel way of evaluating interactive pattern mining methods. Soothsayers are oracles making controlled errors and simulating the learning curve of a user. Originally developed for [WaveLSea](https://hal.science/hal-04589011v1), soothsayers allows us to evaluate the robustness of interactive pattern mining algorithms. The soothsayers have been added to an implementation of LeTSip and Dispale and have given satisfying results. \[[GREYC](https://www.greyc.fr/en/home/)\]

**2022 - 2023: Supervision of an internship in second year of masters degree.**\
The intership was focused on the creation of a User Interface for the SGPEx package. The intern had to: add a websocket to the pre-existing code with [boost beast](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_82_0/libs/beast/doc/html/index.html), create a JavaScript web server using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) for the HTML content and [Cytoscape.js](https://js.cytoscape.org/) for the graph visualization, and run experiments on the WTRFS algorithm. \[[University of Caen Normandy](https://www.unicaen.fr/)\]

**2018 - 2019: Developer internship.**\
Development of a mobile game engine for interactive story telling on Android. Including the User Interface design, sound design, parameters, history management, rollback, etc... The development included the use of Unity, C#, and several other tools. \[[NORSEMAN Interactive](https://www.linkedin.com/company/norseman-interactive/?originalSubdomain=fr)\]
